# project_phase1

The final project app aims to present a demo of the [Mindwatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grcOzIRY3fA&t=34s) where the arousal level of subject is calculated from the skin conductance signal.

The weekly milestones would be: 

* week1: Designing the app environment and provide the background for the user;
Similar source code: [Multi-view](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)

* week2: Writing a code to call the .json file and plot it in the app (offline plot);
Similar source code: [charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts)

* week3: Improve the signal plot by plotting in an online manner such that the app could represent the real-time data;
Similar source code: [Seisometer](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/seismometer)

* week4: Find an approach to communicate between MATLAB/Python and Xcode to use that as a future direction
