# project_phase1

The final project app aims to present a demo of the Mindwatch where the arousal level of subject is calculated from the skin conductance signal.

The weekly milestones would be:

week1: Designing the app environment and provide the background for the user; Similar source code: Multi-view

week2: Writing a code to call the .json file and plot it in the app (offline plot); Similar source code: charts

week3: Improve the signal plot by plotting in an online manner such that the app could represent the real-time data; Similar source code: Seisometer

week4: Find an approach to communicate between MATLAB/Python and Xcode to use that as a future direction
